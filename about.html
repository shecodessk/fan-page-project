        Andrew John Hozier-Byrne (born 17 March 1990), known mononymously as
        Hozier, is an Irish musician, singer, and songwriter. His music
        primarily draws from folk, soul, and blues, often using religious and
        literary themes. He had his international breakthrough after releasing
        his debut single "Take Me to Church", which has been certified
        multi-platinum in several countries.

        As a result of his countryside upbringing, many of Hozier's early music
        exposure came from his parents' blues, jazz, and soul record
        collections, incorporating artists like John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters,
        Bukka White, and Tom Waits. His first musical memories were drawn from
        his father's career as a drummer playing music in Dublin. He has stated
        that his musical education was "grounded" in Chicago blues artists such
        as John Lee Hooker, Otis Redding, and Nina Simone, to whom he pays
        tribute in the track "Nina Cried Power".As a child, he was a fan of the
        bands Stereophonics and Daft Punk. His draws inspiration primarily from
        Irish and African-American artistry; he has said that the "roots" of
        jazz, rock, soul, and R&B have been largely shaped by black culture and
        finds importance in "crediting the legacy you're crediting". His guitar
        work draws from Celtic folk inspiration, as well as musicians Ali Farka
        Toure and Tinariwen. Hozier has stated that "the best vocalists I can
        think of are female". Musically, Hozier has listed Aretha Franklin,
        Johnny Cash, Woody Guthrie, Van Morrison, Ella Fitzgerald, St Vincent,
        Feist, Little Green Cars, Paul Simon, Willie Dixon, and Lisa Hannigan as
        musical and vocal influences.
